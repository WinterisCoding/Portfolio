Web Developer Portfolio


This is the current iteration of my web developer portfolio. Particular points of pride are the keyboard accessibility.
The next thing I plan to add is to integrate linkedIn recommendations in the testimonials section in a carousel and more projects to the project description.

Also plan to add project demonstration videos with Loom.
